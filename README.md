    > :warning: **WARNING**: While system, and steam client are open-source, the architecture of Steam network is not. While this should not cause any endangerment (due to obvious reasons it needs to be closed-source for valve), users who focus on FOSS compatibility should use this system with caution and reconsider using it.

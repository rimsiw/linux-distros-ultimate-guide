        > :information_source: **INFO**: While possible for instaling it on your daily drive machine, it is not advised due to system focus on gaming on Steam Deck, as well as limited out-of-the-box features

        > :warning: **WARNING**: While system, and steam client are open-source, the architecture of Steam network is not. While this should not cause any endangerment (due to obvious reasons it needs to be closed-source for valve), users who focus on FOSS compatibility should use this system with caution and reconsider using it.
